House Price Prediction Project

This project was part of the University of Washington's Machine Learning Certificate program. The objective of this project was to build a regression model that predicts house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors.

Data Source: The dataset used for this project is provided by TuriCreate and includes house sales data.

Tools & Technologies:
Python
TuriCreate for building the regression model
Matplotlib for visualizing the results
Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation

Objective:
Build a regression model to predict house prices.
Use feature selection to improve model performance.
Assess the modelâ€™s performance with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Model Evaluation:
The model performance was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
A validation set was used to ensure the model's reliability and accuracy.

How to Run:
Download the Jupyter notebook from this repository.
Open it in your local Jupyter environment.
Run the cells to see the model training and evaluation process.
